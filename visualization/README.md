# Visualization
This simple utility provides the ability to visualize the pose estimates and scans.
Additionally, a voxel map can be saved, generated by registering sequential point clouds and voxelizing at a configured resolution.
A sample result is shown and the usage is outlined below.

[Demo!](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ad6a1b6-ad32-4d58-9210-2a81b309b34d)

## Usage
1. Install the requirements.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Edit the config/config.yaml file.
```yaml
---
# Scans and pose estimate
pose_file: /path_to_the_pose_file
pc_folder_path: /path_to_bin_folder/

# Plotting
pt_size: 1.0
z_min: -3       # For the point cloud and map color
z_max: 3        # For the point cloud and map color

# Map
voxel_size: 1.0
map_output_file: /path_to_map_save_file

# Configuration
visualize_scans: true
make_map: true
```
3. Run the viewer.
```bash
python3 src/pc_viewer.py config/config.yaml
```
