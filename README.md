# SiMpLE Minimal Configuration LiDAR odometry
Simple Mapping and Localisation Estimation ([SiMpLE](https://doi.org/10.1177/02783649241235325)) is a low-drift and low-configuration LiDAR odometry method providing accurate localization and mapping with a variety of sensors.

***Refactoring in progress!**
